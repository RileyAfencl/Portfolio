### About Me
Hey! I'm Riley Fencl—a former bartender turned data scientist. Years of engaging with people behind the bar taught me how to read between the lines, tell compelling stories, and communicate to any audience in any environment. I specialize in using R and Python to uncover insights and build predictive models, with a strong interest in machine learning. My portfolio showcases projects where I break down complex data and make it actionable. I’m always looking for opportunities to blend analytical rigor with clear communication to drive impact. Welcome to my portfolio!
