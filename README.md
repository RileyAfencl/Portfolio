### About Me
Hey! I'm Riley Fencl—a former bartender turned data scientist. Years of engaging with people behind the bar taught me how to read between the lines, tell compelling stories, and communicate to any audience in any environment. I specialize in using R and Python to uncover insights and build predictive models, with a strong interest in machine learning. My portfolio showcases projects where I break down complex data and make it actionable. I’m always looking for opportunities to blend analytical rigor with clear communication to drive impact. Welcome to my portfolio!

### Projects
These are my top 3 projects that demonstrate my skills the best! All of these projects can be found in my projects repository at: https://github.com/RileyAfencl/Projects

For me, my projects are all about demonstrating thinking and code documentation. I put a huge emphasis on the ability to follow along with my process, the ability to understand my code, and why I followed the steps that I did. I think each of the projects below capture that goal quite adequately and I am proud to show them off!

#### K-Means Clustering Model
This is a project where I took customer purchasing data and used k-means clustering to derive the natural categories from the data, and then compared those categories to create real-world actionable insights. 
This project demonstrates my technical skill in exploratory anaylsis, data cleaning/preparation, cluster modeling and ultimately a large degree of practical understanding and application. Further, this project
shows my capabilities in leveraging data to assist with marketing. 

You can find the project code here: https://github.com/RileyAfencl/Projects/blob/main/K-Means%20Clustering%20Project/K-Means%20Clustering%20Project%20Code

#### Random Forest Model
In this project I created a random forest model to predict food delilvery times. Ultimately, the model was quite powerful and this project demonstrates further my technical knowledge and understanding of data-modeling. 
Not only does this model demonstrate a clear modeling process, it also demonstrates my understanding of data conceptually. Within the modeling process, many decision have to be made, and problems and issues have to be 
addressed and this project does an exemplary job of tackling those challenges head on.

#### Neural Network Model
In this project I created a neural network model based on bank data to attempt to predict customer churn. This project demonstrates my understanding of how to solve bigger problems that might be out of the scope of any 
individual model. Not only do I correctly identify some of the structural issues with the data (80/20 classification imbalance), I also explain and demonstrate solutions to these complex issues. I successfully create and optimize a neural network, and I also identify potential paths forward and solutions to the weaknesses of the network.
